\subsection{Observations and comments}
In conclusion of this project, we are satisfied with the outcome and have found ourselves to be accurate in the inspection, as evidenced by the positive feedback during user testing. This has reaffirmed the importance of a precise initial assessment to effectively guide the design improvement process. The integration of data collected during the inspection and user testing has yielded interesting results, highlighting the value of combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies to gain a more comprehensive view of website performance. Overall, the process has been extremely useful and successful, enabling us to effectively identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions to optimize the user experience. 

For many of us, this has been the first experience applying design evaluation methodologies, and this process has been extremely productive and educational. It has provided us with valuable skills and contributed to a better understanding of the importance of user engagement and data analysis in digital experience design.
